# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Java and Swing
INTERNSAVY--INTERNSHIP

I have developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java and the Swing library as part of my internship at Internsavy. This project showcases my skills in object-oriented programming and graphical user interface (GUI) development. The game provides a classic gaming experience where two players can compete against each other to achieve victory in the timeless game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

The graphical interface of the game is implemented using Java's Swing library, which allows for an interactive and visually appealing user experience. The game board is displayed on the screen, providing a grid of cells where players can place their X's and O's. The application also includes features such as a score tracker, highlighting the winning combination, and an option to restart the game.

To ensure a smooth gameplay experience, I have implemented a comprehensive logic for validating moves, checking for a win or a draw, and updating the score accordingly. The game follows the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, where players take turns placing their symbols on the board until one player achieves a winning combination or the game ends in a draw.

Throughout the development process, I have focused on writing clean and maintainable code. I have utilized Java's object-oriented principles to structure the project into logical components, such as the game engine, user interface, and player management. This modular approach enhances code reusability and makes the project easier to understand and extend.

Feel free to explore the source code and experiment with the game. I hope you enjoy playing this implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe and find it both entertaining and informative in terms of my skills as a Java developer.
